How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
It found out all the lines of code that were changed and hence we found the line which had the actual error.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

while devloping projects it happens that a change or two could ruin your will to devlop as they drastically 
ruin the functionality of the project.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
Pros:					cons:		
No problem if forgot to commit.			too much of versons of file..at every smal change
automatically saves versions for you
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

bcz git is a code based version control sytem,while others are basically text based .

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

  git log tells the name and comment with commit while diff tells the difference between the two versions


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

I can rollback to my working stage any time and see what went wrong ..i am loving it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

 I want to use git for all my projects now. i like it
